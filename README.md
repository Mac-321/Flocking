# Flocking
This is a second year software project during a Module on Java. In this project we replicate the Flocking simulator originally envisoned by Craig Reynolds []. Who introduced the concept of Agent-Based modelling (ABM's) and their use in modelling animal behaviour. He introduced a Framework that models animals such as birds and fish shoaling or (flocking or cohesion), while not crashing into each other (seperation) and Allignment the average direction of the group.

The rules that dictate the Agents behaviour isnt implemented directly with vectors and is instead done with Angles due to the requirments of the Assignment.;


Graphic design is my passion. Shown by the "quality" !
